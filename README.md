# GitOps
We are going to write everything in the form of code, thats pattern of GitOps.

1. GitOps refers all the actions should be in the form of code & hosted on git.
2. This gives an opportunity to version control the chnages.
3. Ans at the same time, it can help us with approvals.

GitOps is a software development & deployment framework that uses Git as a Source Control System, to manage infrastructure & application code deployments.
